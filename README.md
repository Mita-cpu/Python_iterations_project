> This is a  project that demonstrates the Author's understanding of Python iterations using methods by solving the following challeges:

1. Creating a method that returns doubled array of numbers.
2. Creating a method which checks if a string is a Palindrome.
3. Creating a method that says goodbye to a name.
4. Creating a method that finds average of numbers.
5. Creating a method that prints numbers divisible by two numbers but not both.
